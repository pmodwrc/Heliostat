# Installation guide

To install the Heliostat on a new PC connect the CAN Bus from the Heliostat via the D sub cable and the 4Q sensor via the serial port with the PC. Afterwards the the CAN Bus and the 4Q sensor should be visible in the device manager. Then install the appropriate driver from [Kvaser](https://www.kvaser.com/download/). The driver can also be found on the server of PMOD/WRC. Afterwards you have to get the executable file and the belonging ui files. Make sure the ui files are in a folder called `ui_files` that is in the same directory as the executable file. 

Good luck and have fun with the Heliostat.
