## Actuators

Both heliostat axes are driven by stepper motors with micro stepping capability (1 microstep = 0.007Â°). The motor drivers are directly attached to the motors and communicate with the control computer via the CAN-Bus. The motors and drivers operate with 24V DC. A backlash free harmonic drive gearbox with a transmission ratio of 160:1 is installed
between the motor shaft and the mirror to further improve the step resolution.
