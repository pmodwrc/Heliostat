# PRM Module

This class has functions to calculate and rotate the vectors and lines that are needed to make a plot of the position of the mirrors to eachother and to the observatory wall. Furthermore this class has functions that project the mirrors from a three dimensional space to a plane. This helps the operator to have an impression of the current position of the Heliostat in front of the laboratory.
